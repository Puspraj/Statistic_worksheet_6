Subjective Answer:

10>Answer: Bayes' theorem, named after 18th-century British mathematician Thomas Bayes, is
           is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probability. Conditional 
           probability is the likelihood of an outcome occurring, based on a previous outcome
           occurring. If A and B denote two events, P(A|B) denotes the conditional probability
           of A occurring, given that B occurs. Bayes theorem gives a relation between P(A|B)
           and P(B|A).

11>Answer: A Z-score describes the position of a raw score in terms of its distance fro the 
           mean, when measured in standard deviation units. The z-score is positive if the 
           value lies above the mean, and negative if it lies below the mean.

          Formula of z-score:

           z=(Xi-X')/s

12>Answer: The t-test is any statistical hypothesis test in which the test statistic follows
           a Student's t-distribution under the null hypothesis. A t-test is the most commonly
           applied when the test statistic would follow a normal distribution if the value of 
           a scaling term in the test statistic were known.

          Formula of t-test:

              t=(m-u)/s/(n)sqrt

13>Answer: In statistics, a percentile is a type of quantile which divides the given probability 
           or sample, into 100 equal-sized intervals; this allows the data to be analyzed in terms
           of percentages.

14>Answer: Analysis of variance is a collection of statistical models and their associated estimation 
           procedures used to analyze the differences among group means in a sample. ANOVA was develo
           -ped by the statistician Ronald Fisher.

           An ANOVA test is a way to find out if survey or experiment results are significant. In other
           words, they help you to figure out if you need to reject the null hypothesis or accept the 
           alternate hypothesis.

15>Answer: An ANOVA test they help you to figure out if you need to reject the null hypothesis or accept
           the alternate hypothesis. Basically, you're testing groups to see if there's a difference
           between them.
